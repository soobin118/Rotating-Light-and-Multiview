# Rotating-Light-and-Multiview

*This project is implemented using OpenGL.*

I implemented a car of which texture is brick pattern and an artificial light which rotates around the car by the mouse input.  
The car consists of a hexahedron, a sphere, and tori.  
The light is implemented using wire cone.  
Then, I divided the screen into four. Each screen displays the same model by four view directions.
